        <h2>The Wave of Third Generation Computers</h2>
        <p>
            The term 'third generation computers' derives from the advancement in computers in 1964 and the
            materialisation of <b>integrated circuits (IC)</b> or also known as the silicon chip. This advancement saw
            computers improve in both speed and size by building the components into one crystal, which traditionally
            were built into separate crystals. This improvement in size and speed allowed this generation of computers
            to penetrate the wider consumer market with the introduction of the computer terminal; a monitor and
            keyboard that connected via telephone lines.

            It was also the same time Floppy disks were introduced for storage, the first introduction of portable data. (Thomas, 2021)
